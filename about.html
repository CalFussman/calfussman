            Weeks after Cal spoke at Facebook, Chris Sanders in Global Marketing Solutions said: “We literally have people using the term, ‘Cal Question.’ He has become a part of our culture.”
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
            Cal’s speaking career blossomed after millions of people heard him interviewed on Tim Ferriss’s podcast. “When I told my podcast listeners that I was doing a second interview with Cal,” said Ferriss, “dozens replied with some variation of ‘Please just let Cal talk for three hours. I could listen to him tell stories forever.’"

        <p class="body-text">
            As a writer for Esquire, ESPN, GQ, Sports Illustrated and The Washington Post Sunday Magazine over the years, Cal has transformed oral history into an art form, conducting probing interviews with the icons who’ve shaped the last half-century of world history, including: Mikhail Gorbachev, Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson, Jimmy Carter, Serena Williams, Ted Kennedy, Quincy Jones, Jack Welch, Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino, Muhammad Ali, and hundreds of others. The Austin Chronicle has described Fussman's interviewing skills as "peerless."

        <p class="body-text">
            Born in Brooklyn, Fussman spent ten straight years traveling the world, swimming over 18-foot tiger sharks, rolling around with mountain gorillas in Rwanda, and searching for gold in the Amazon. He boxed against then-undefeated world champion Julio Cesar Chavez, served as sommelier atop of the World Trade Center and won a James Beard award.

            He now lives with his wife—whom he met while on his quest to discover the world’s most beautiful beach—and guides his three children from Los Angeles, where he spends every morning eating breakfast with Larry King.
