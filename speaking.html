                <p>Disruption is one of the most relevant topics on the minds of business leaders today. Whether it’s how a company can disrupt an industry, or prevent against being disrupted, the solution is the same. Through curiosity.</p>

    <h1>The Question is the Answer</h1>
    
    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
    <ul class="takeaways">
        <li>Understand powerful ways to open a conversation through the interactive exercise.</li>
        <li>Learn the techniques of making deeper connections through Cal’s Heart, Head and Soul approach.</li>
        <li>Gain insights into the power of storytelling.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The session begins with an interactive exercise that demonstrates to the group how the right questions can lead to deeper connections and relationships. The exercise is also an incredible bonding experience for companies and conferences looking to bring people closer together.</p>
    <p>The core of the keynote showcases Cal’s powerful experiences connecting with Gorbachev, traveling around the world for a decade without a home, and spending a week with Muhammad Ali. Through these stories, Cal teaches techniques that quickly build rapport and stronger relationships.</p>
    <p>*A conversation segment follows most keynotes, where the audience has the opportunity to ask Cal about specific interests and issues.</p>

    <h1>DISRUPTION STARTS WITH CURIOSITY</h1>
    
    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
    <ul class="takeaways">
        <li>Make people realize that losing their curiosity should be their biggest fear.</li>
        <li>Make sure success doesn’t blind a company to curiosity.</li>
        <li>Make it a routine to break routine.</li>
        <li>Realize that when in a storm, curiosity is not a waste of time, it’s a life-line.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is a short interactive interview exercise at the outset that focuses around the question. “If you could meet anybody who’s ever lived, who would that be and why?” Which leads to a surprising way to frame the responses, and ignites people to think differently.</p>
    <p>The core of the keynote offers many ways to refresh one’s curiosity through the lens of disruption. The keynote includes lessons from John F. Kennedy’s assassination, Jackie Robinson’s integration of baseball, Kodak’s inability to see the future of the digital camera and how companies like CNN were conceived with a simple question rooted in ordinary curiosity. By the end, everybody can see what he or she is capable of achieving with a good question.</p>

    <p>The session begins with an interactive interview exercise that allows people to identify their own fears of stepping out of their comfort zone and understand how the bold decisions they’ve made in their past enabled them to reach greater heights.</p>
    <p>The core of the keynote looks at how General Motors CEO Mary Barra, actor Tom Hanks, tennis star Serena Williams, fighter-pilot Chuck Yeager, billionaire T. Boone Pickens and many others pushed past their hesitations to get where they wanted to go, and then went even further.</p>
